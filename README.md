# Attendance-system

Designed and implemented a printed circuit board (PCB) using Altium Designer to design the layout of an “Attendance system using Radio-frequency identification (RFID)” application and write C code to program 8086 microcontroller.

The system recognizes the users by their specific card using Radio-frequency identification (RFID) as there are already registered. The system keeps the count of the allowed users that attended the meeting (lecture, seminar, ..) and the LCD displays the number of attendees.
